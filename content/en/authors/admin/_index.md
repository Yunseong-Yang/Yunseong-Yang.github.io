Hello, my name is Yunseong-Yang, I'm currently a junior in the Department of Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence at Jeonbuk National University. My main field of interest is games, and my current goal is to continue studying the Unity game engine and release an independent game through it.

As an undergraduate project, I had developed 'Renting a home and Pretecting others from COVID-19'(Windows Programming) and 'Tanghulu Planner' (Mobile Programming). In the future, In the future, I plan to create an action platformer game like "Getting Over It" or "AltF4" using Unity.
