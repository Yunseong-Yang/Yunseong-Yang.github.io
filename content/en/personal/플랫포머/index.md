I'm currently working on a platformer game with Unity. Platformers are a genre where you only need to get from a starting point to a destination, but they are characterized by complex controls and the risk of falling back to the starting point if you make a mistake. Examples of games in this genre include 'Getting Over It', 'Jump King', etc. We plan to imitate these genre games to understand the framework and then plan what elements to make a platformer game with.
